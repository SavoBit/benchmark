# Getting Started

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), developed by Facebook, is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs. In addition to the traditional [REST API](/rest/guide/), Parse Server automatically generates a GraphQL API based on your current application schema.

The easiest way to run the Parse GraphQL Server is using the CLI:

```bash
$ npm install -g parse-server mongodb-runner
$ mongodb-runner start
$ parse-server --appId APPLICATION_ID --masterKey MASTER_KEY --databaseURI mongodb://localhost/test --mountGraphQL --mountPlayground
```

Notes:
* Run `parse-server --help` or refer to [Parse Server Options](https://parseplatform.org/parse-server/api/master/ParseServerOptions.html) for a complete list of Parse Server configuration options.
* ⚠️ Please do not use `--mountPlayground` option in production as anyone could access your API Playground and read or change your application's data. [Parse Dashboard](#running-parse-dashboard) has a built-in GraphQL Playground and it is the recommended option for production apps.
* ⚠️ The Parse GraphQL ```beta``` implementation is fully functional but discussions are taking place on how to improve it. So new versions of Parse Server can bring breaking changes to the current API.

After running the CLI command, you should have something like this in your terminal:

<img alt="Parse GraphQL Server" data-echo="{{ '/assets/images/graphql/parse-graphql-server.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}"/>

Since you have already started your Parse GraphQL Server, you can now visit [http://localhost:1337/playground](http://localhost:1337/playground) in your web browser to start playing with your GraphQL API.

## Using Docker

You can also run the Parse GraphQL API inside a Docker container:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server
$ cd parse-server
$ docker build --tag parse-server .
$ docker run --name my-mongo -d mongo
$ docker run --name my-parse-server --link my-mongo:mongo -d parse-server --appId APPLICATION_ID --masterKey MASTER_KEY --databaseURI mongodb://mongo/test --mountGraphQL --mountPlayground
```

After starting the server, you can visit [http://localhost:1337/playground](http://localhost:1337/playground) in your browser to start playing with your GraphQL API.

⚠️ Please do not use `--mountPlayground` option in production as anyone could access your API Playground and read or change your application's data. [Parse Dashboard](#running-parse-dashboard) has a built-in GraphQL Playground and it is the recommended option for production apps.

## Using Express.js

You can also mount the GraphQL API in an Express.js application together with the REST API or solo:

```js
const express = require('express');
const { default: ParseServer, ParseGraphQLServer } = require('parse-server');

const app = express();

const parseServer = new ParseServer({
  databaseURI: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/test',
  appId: 'APPLICATION_ID',
  masterKey: 'MASTER_KEY',
  serverURL: 'http://localhost:1337/parse'
});

const parseGraphQLServer = new ParseGraphQLServer(
  parseServer,
  {
    graphQLPath: '/graphql',
    playgroundPath: '/playground'
  }
);

app.use('/parse', parseServer.app); // (Optional) Mounts the REST API
parseGraphQLServer.applyGraphQL(app); // Mounts the GraphQL API
parseGraphQLServer.applyPlayground(app); // (Optional) Mounts the GraphQL Playground - do NOT use in Production

app.listen(1337, function() {
  console.log('REST API running on http://localhost:1337/parse');
  console.log('GraphQL API running on http://localhost:1337/graphql');
  console.log('GraphQL Playground running on http://localhost:1337/playground');
});
```

After starting the server, you can visit [http://localhost:1337/playground](http://localhost:1337/playground) in your browser to start playing with your GraphQL API.

⚠️ Please do not mount the GraphQL Playground in production as anyone could access your API Playground and read or change your application's data. [Parse Dashboard](#running-parse-dashboard) has a built-in GraphQL Playground and it is the recommended option for production apps.

## Running Parse Dashboard

[Parse Dashboard](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-dashboard) is a standalone dashboard for managing your Parse Server apps, including your objects' schema and data, logs, jobs, and push notifications. Parse Dashboard also has a built-in GraphQL Playground that you can use to play around with your auto-generated Parse GraphQL API. It is the recommended option for production applications.

The easiest way to run the Parse Dashboard is through its CLI:

```bash
$ npm install -g parse-dashboard
$ parse-dashboard --dev --appId APPLICATION_ID --masterKey MASTER_KEY --serverURL "http://localhost:1337/parse" --graphQLServerURL "http://localhost:1337/graphql" --appName MyAppName
```

After starting the dashboard, you can visit [http://0.0.0.0:4040/apps/MyAppName/api_console/graphql](http://0.0.0.0:4040/apps/MyAppName/api_console/graphql) in your browser:
